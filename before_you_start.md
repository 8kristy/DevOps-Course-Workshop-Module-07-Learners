# Before you start

## Installs

You will need to have installed the following:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    - Make sure you have the [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

It is useful, but not vital, to have the following as well. These will allow you to build & run the app locally to get a sense for what steps we are trying to reproduce on the CI server:
- [NodeJS + NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [.NET SDK (7.0)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
  - If you are on Windows, include the optional Windows build tools offered by the installer
